What are the rules for a float? 

A float may contain only integers
1232345
A float may contain only decimals 
.23232323
A float may contain both
12121.88354 
A float may not contain anything else 

There must be at least a number, or a decimal, or both 

The inner group says a . plus at least one digit 
(\.\d+)? 
The outher condition say that this can be there zero or one time 

(\d*) - the first number can be there 0 or infinite times 

Now the last condition, the most difficult one:
There must be at least either the first group or the second group.
